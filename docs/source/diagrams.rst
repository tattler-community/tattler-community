Diagrams
========

.. epigraph::
    A picture is worth a thousand words.

    -- Conventional wisdom

There you go -- the essential diagrams. They follow the `C4 model <https://c4model.com>`_ so "there's no argument on what's
in them, only the way to show it".

They use `mermaid <https://mermaid.js.org>`_, so if you don't like the order of the elements, you know whom to blame ðŸ™‚

Similarly, switch to **light mode** if they are not well-readable in dark mode.
