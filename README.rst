What is tattler?
================

Are you building an online service and need to send beautiful, branded notifications via email or SMS to your users?

Tattler makes that easy for you. Your application makes a simple HTTP call to tattler:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:11503/notification/mywebapp/password_changed/?user=123'

and tattler does this for you:

1. Load your templates for event ``password_changed``, and see where it should be notified. (Email? SMS? More?)
2. Load the email address and mobile number for user ``123`` as required -- with trivial-to-write plug-ins.
3. Load any variable that your templates require -- with trivial-to-write plug-ins. (What plan is the user on? How much of the plan is used up?)
4. Expand the template and encode the content into an actual notification -- e.g. a multi-part MIME email with HTML and plain text fallback.
5. Deliver the final content through SMTP and an SMS delivery network.

Tattler is designed with simplicity in mind. It strives to be easy to adopt and useful among common needs -- so you
can focus on your communication, brand and customer journey.

If your system sends notifications from multiple different softwares -- say a web application, a billing daemon,
and a cron job which monitors inventory -- then your simplification gains with tattlers get multipled üöÄ

Quick start
===========

Install tattler:

.. code-block:: bash

   # create and load a virtualenv to install into
   mkdir ~/tattler_quickstart
   python3 -m venv ~/tattler_quickstart/venv
   . ~/tattler_quickstart/venv/bin/activate

   # install tattler into it
   pip install tattler

Run tattler server:

.. code-block:: bash

   export TATTLER_MASTER_MODE=production
   
   # if you need to customize your SMTP settings
   export TATTLER_SMTP_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:25"
   export TATTLER_SMTP_AUTH="username:password" # you will learn secure configuration later
   export TATTLER_SMTP_TLS=yes

   # run tattler server on default 127.0.0.1:11503
   tattler_server

Trigger a demo notification via HTTP:

.. code-block:: bash

   # in a new terminal:
   
   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:11503/notification/demoscope/demoevent/?mode=production&user=your@email.com'

... or via command-line utility:

.. code-block:: bash

   # load the same virtual environment where you installed tattler server
   . ~/tattler_quickstart/venv/bin/activate

   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   tattler_notify -s '127.0.0.1:11503' -m production your@email.com demoscope demoevent

... or via tattler's python SDK:

.. code-block:: python3

   from tattler.client.tattler_py import send_notification

   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   send_notification('demoscope', 'demoevent', 'your@email.com', mode='production', srv_addr='127.0.0.1', srv_port=11503)

Done!
