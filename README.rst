👀 What is tattler?
===================

Are you building an online service and need to send beautiful, branded notifications via email or SMS to your users?

Tattler makes that easy for you. Your application makes a simple HTTP call to tattler:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:11503/notification/mywebapp/password_changed/?user=123'

Tattler helps you with these:

1. **Templates**: Load templates for event ``password_changed`` for email, SMS etc.
2. **Addressbook**: Fetch the user's email address and mobile number from your DB (with trivial-to-write plug-ins).
3. **Template data**: Fetch variables for your templates from your DB (with trivial-to-write plug-ins).
4. **MIME**: Package a multi-part email with HTML+text fallback.
5. **Delivery**: Send the content through SMTP and an SMS delivery network.
6. **Dev mode**: Let your applications trigger notifications to the real user and have tattler only deliver it to your debug address.

Tattler is designed with simplicity in mind. It strives to be easy to adopt and useful among common needs -- so you
can focus on your communication, brand and customer journey.

If your system sends notifications from multiple different softwares -- say a web application, a billing daemon,
and a cron job which monitors inventory -- then your simplification gains with tattlers get multipled 🚀

😵‍💫 Don't beat around the bush!
---------------------------------

Tattler is:

- a server
- written in python
- for UNIX systems
- that exposes a REST interface
- which your applications contact
- to request delivery of notifications to users.


🤩 Examples

🚀 Quick start
=================

Install tattler:

.. code-block:: bash

   # create and load a virtualenv to install into
   mkdir ~/tattler_quickstart
   python3 -m venv ~/tattler_quickstart/venv
   . ~/tattler_quickstart/venv/bin/activate

   # install tattler into it
   pip install tattler

Run tattler server:

.. code-block:: bash

   export TATTLER_MASTER_MODE=production
   
   # if you need to customize your SMTP settings
   export TATTLER_SMTP_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:25"
   export TATTLER_SMTP_AUTH="username:password" # you will learn secure configuration later
   export TATTLER_SMTP_TLS=yes

   # run tattler server on default 127.0.0.1:11503
   tattler_server

Trigger a demo notification via HTTP:

.. code-block:: bash

   # in a new terminal:
   
   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:11503/notification/demoscope/demoevent/?mode=production&user=your@email.com'

... or via command-line utility:

.. code-block:: bash

   # load the same virtual environment where you installed tattler server
   . ~/tattler_quickstart/venv/bin/activate

   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   tattler_notify -s '127.0.0.1:11503' -m production your@email.com demoscope demoevent

... or via tattler's python SDK:

.. code-block:: python3

   from tattler.client.tattler_py import send_notification

   # replace ``your@email.com`` with your actual email address
   send_notification('demoscope', 'demoevent', 'your@email.com', mode='production', srv_addr='127.0.0.1', srv_port=11503)

Done!
