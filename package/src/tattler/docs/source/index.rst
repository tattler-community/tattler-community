Tattler -- an enterprise notification system
============================================

Do you want to send beautifully branded notifications to your users?

Tattler makes it easy for you. Your application makes a simple HTTP call to tattler:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:11503/notification/mywebapp/password_changed/?user=123'

and tattler does this for you:

1. Find out what vectors event ``password_changed`` should be notified to. Email? SMS? More?
2. Determine for which of those vectors user ``123`` provided contact data for.
3. Load the respective notification templates.
4. Fetch any data your templates require (with easy-to-write plug-ins). For example: on what plan is the user? Any unpaid invoice?
5. Encode all the resulting content into an actual notification -- e.g. a multi-part MIME email including HTML and plain text parts.
6. Deliver the final content through SMTP and an SMS delivery network.

That's a few chores removed -- so you can focus on your communication, brand and customer journey.
